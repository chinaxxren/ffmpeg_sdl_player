Based on the provided code snippet, this project appears to be a video playback system implemented in Rust. Here's a summary of its components and functionality:
External Libraries:
The project uses the ffmpeg_next crate for handling video streams and decoding video packets.
It also uses the futures crate for asynchronous programming and the smol crate for async channels and tasks.
VideoPlaybackThread Struct:
This struct manages the video playback process. It contains channels for sending control commands and video packets, as well as a thread for receiving and processing these packets.
Start Method:
Initializes the video playback by setting up channels for control commands and video packets.
Creates a decoder context from the video stream parameters and initializes a video decoder.
Spawns a new thread to handle video packet reception and decoding asynchronously.
Packet Reception and Decoding:
The thread continuously receives video packets, sends them to the decoder, and processes the decoded frames.
It uses a StreamClock to synchronize video frame display with the stream's presentation timestamps (PTS).
Control Commands:
The system can receive control commands to pause or play the video, which are handled in the main loop of the receiver thread.
StreamClock Struct:
This struct is used to convert PTS values to real-time durations, helping to synchronize video playback with the correct timing.
Drop Implementation:
Ensures that resources are cleaned up when a VideoPlaybackThread instance is dropped, including closing the control channel and joining the receiver thread.
Overall, this project is designed to handle video playback by decoding video streams and managing playback control asynchronously.
